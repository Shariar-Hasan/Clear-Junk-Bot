    If you want to make a change in the script you can just right click on the shortcut script or the main script, and click edit. It will open your notepad.
    now you have to figure out what change you want to make in the script.


    #####  Make the script faster
    If you want  to kick the timer section out and make the script one click quick run just delete the section area shown below for every part.
`echo` and `timeout` are the part of section area.
Remember! delete this if you want your code to run fast, else you don't need to touch the section area.

    When you open the script in notepad or other text editor,
you can see in line 10,
`color 90` this is the color of background and text.
the first digit denotes the color of background and second digit denotes the color of font .
By default, background color denotes 9 which is blue and the font color denotes 0 which is black. like the picture below:
